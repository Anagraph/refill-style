    # To make Refill's colorize-able icons play nice with other styles
    # we re-state the global here in the Refill color theme to use colorized_icons.
    # This allows the Refill color theme to import *after* say Walkabout icons
    # and then colorize Walkabout's icons. But when imported before Walkabout icons
    # then Walkabout icons would not be colorized as Walkabout icons re-set the
    # global to "" (null).
